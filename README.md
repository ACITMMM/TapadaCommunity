## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the development environment and running the app on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: Follow the official guide to [install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Git: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if not already installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ACITMMM/TapadaCommunity.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd TapadaCommunity
   ```
   
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Create the debug key.

```keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
What is your first and last name?
  [Unknown]:  Tapada
What is the name of your organizational unit?
  [Unknown]:  Community
What is the name of your organization?
  [Unknown]:  TDM
What is the name of your City or Locality?
  [Unknown]:  Cintra
What is the name of your State or Province?
  [Unknown]:  LX
What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
  [Unknown]:  PT
Is CN=Tapada, OU=Community, O=TDM, L=Cintra, ST=LX, C=PT correct?
  [no]:  yes

Generating 2,048 bit RSA key pair and self-signed certificate (SHA256withRSA) with a validity of 10,000 days
	for: CN=Tapada, OU=Community, O=TDM, L=Cintra, ST=LX, C=PT```
   
5. List the SHA-1 and SHA-256 fingerprints for your `debug.keystore`, which usually lies on an `.android` folder inside your home folder.

   5a. For Linux and Mac:

   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
   ```

   5b. For Windows:

   ```bash
   keytool -list -v -keystore C:\Users\<your-username>\.android\debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
   ```
   
   The output should contain the following snippet (with different fingerprint values):

   ```
   ...
   Certificate fingerprints:
      SHA1: 37:E8:22:2F:B0:E6:7C:F5:D3:EB:FB:B1:DE:1F:17:E4:1C:E5:03:65
      SHA256: 67:C8:79:A6:50:C8:F9:3E:5E:C7:12:00:D3:6A:E4:B1:50:0D:63:64:84:EB:6D:A1:F6:1C:97:E6:30:AE:F0:97
   ...
   ```


6. Add SHA certificate fingerprints to the [Android App on Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/tapadacommunity/settings/general/android:org.acitmmm.tapadacommunity).
   
   **IMPORTANT**: Add both SHA-1 and SHA-256.
      

7. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   4a. if you have more than one device connected you might choose one:
   
      ```
      Connected devices:

      ```

8. After choose anh device flutter will compile the code for the platform and a menu like that might appear:

   ```bash
   Launching lib/main.dart on SM A405FN in debug mode...
   Running Gradle task 'assembleDebug'...                                146.9s

   Flutter run key commands.
   r Hot reload. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
   R Hot restart.
   h List all available interactive commands.
   d Detach (terminate "flutter run" but leave application running).
   c Clear the screen
